Getting knowledge via doing! 

Hello, friends ðŸ‘‹ With great pleasure, I announce the completion of my first machine learning mini-project, a "Movie Recommendation System" with Navin Prasath Kalaiselvan.

Among the things I've discovered in the meanwhile, 

1. A machine learning model's fundamental process. 

2. Gathering and pre-processing data. 

3. Extracting characteristics that are pertinent to the system. 

4. Text data is vectorized to numerical data. 

5. Calculating and applying the cosine similarity score measurement. 

6. Python use cases for the difflib library.
